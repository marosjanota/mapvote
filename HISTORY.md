# MapVote Development History

This document tracks the complete development history of the MapVote Election Map Builder application. Use this as context for future development sessions.

## Project Overview

**MapVote** is a web application for creating, customizing, and sharing election maps. Maps are rendered in SVG format using D3.js projections and GeoJSON/TopoJSON data, ensuring scalability, exportability, and integration into reports, presentations, or broadcast graphics.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Map Rendering**: D3.js with GeoJSON/TopoJSON
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (MUI)
- **Data Formats**: GeoJSON, TopoJSON, CSV, JSON
- **Export Formats**: SVG, PNG
